This new mod brings a totally new way of changing segment types of buildings, without needing to deform them "making the segments touchable", as like Touch This! Mod used to do.

So, it allows you to, beyond upgrading roads, also change platform types* of stations (Example: Trains to Metro or vice-versa, or any other transport types between!).

See the thread linked below to see what this mod can do for you! At the end of it there's a UI explanation.

<color yellow>(*) Train stations may not be able to spawn Metro vehicles and vice-versa. So be sure to be using other stations that can do it (natives from transport type) in the lines.</color>

<color yellow>Update r1 (19/OCT/21):</color>
