<color #AA44FF>Touch This! Tool</color> now is <color #AA44FF>Upgrade Untouchable</color>

This new version brings a totally new way of changing segment types of buildings, without needing to deform them "making the segments touchable", as like Touch This! used to do.

So, it allows you to, beyond upgrading roads, also change platform types* from station (Example: Train to Metro or vice-versa).

See the thread linked below to check how powerful this new mod is.

<color yellow>(*) Train stations may not be able to spawn Metro vehicles and vice-versa. So be sure to be using other stations that can do it (natives from transport type) in the lines.</color> Transport Lines Manager Mod will be able to handle fully this issue in the future, however.
